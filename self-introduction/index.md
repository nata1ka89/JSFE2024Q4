Hello, my name is Natalia, I am 35 years old and I live in Belarus. 
I hold a degree in Engineering Economics from the Belarusian National Technical University. Most recently, I worked as a leading cost engineer in a construction company. 
However, in last year, I decided to radically change my career path and decided to try myself in the world of Front-end development. I was inspired by this direction, because it allows to experiment and immediately see the results of your efforts.
In June of the same year, I began training at Rolling Scopes School. I successfully completed the initial stage and continued to the first stage. 
During my training, I have acquired numerous valuable skills including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I have also completed several educational projects. 
Of course, it was challenging, and there were difficulties with mastering of the material.
Studying takes up all my time, but this does not stop me, and I am ready to move forward.
The educational projects during stages 0 and 1 were engaging and interesting.
I developed interactive websites, crafted a gallery using the Unsplash API, built an audio player, and programmed games such as Nonograms and Simon Says. 
The last Nonograms project was notably difficult, but very interesting, as it required me to implement complex game functions and rely solely on JavaScript for rendering, and leaving the HTML structure minimal as it possible.
I would also admit that cross-checking was a real stress test for me, but I passed it successfully.
My primary objective is to master in JavaScript, become a proficient front-end developer, and find a job where I can contribute to meaningful projects that positively impact others.
I want to express my gratitude to RS School for giving everyone the opportunity to find themselves and realize their dreams.
Thanks, for watching, bye!
