# Game Nonograms
## What is this?
Nonograms is a puzzle game to reveal a hidden picture by looking at the number clues. The clues are given at the top and left side of the grid. Each number in these clue defines a block of black cell. A number indicates an unbroken line of black cells, and they are in the same order as the lines.
